# üöÄ Deploy Bot for 24/7 Operation

## Current Status
‚úÖ Code is ready with webhook setup page  
‚úÖ OpenAPI schema updated with webhook endpoints  
‚ùå **Need to deploy to production** (this is why you see 404)

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Current Code
**Click the "Deploy" button in Replit** to push your changes to production at `https://evo-exchange.com`

This will make available:
- `/setup-webhook` - Interactive setup page
- `/api/webhook/telegram/set` - Webhook configuration endpoint
- `/api/webhook/telegram/info` - Webhook status check
- `/api/telegram/health` - Bot health monitoring

### 2. After Deployment Complete
1. Open `https://evo-exchange.com/setup-webhook`
2. Click "Enable 24/7 Operation" button
3. Bot switches from polling to webhooks
4. Test by closing Replit and sending `/help` to @EvokeEssenceBot

### 3. Expected Results
- **Before webhook**: Bot stops when Replit closes
- **After webhook**: Bot runs 24/7 on Cloudflare infrastructure

## Why This Works
- **Webhook mode**: Telegram sends messages directly to your Cloudflare server
- **No polling needed**: Bot doesn't need to check for messages
- **True 24/7 operation**: Independent of Replit development environment

**Ready to deploy? Click the Deploy button!**

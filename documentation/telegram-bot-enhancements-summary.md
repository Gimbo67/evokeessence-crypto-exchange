‚úÖ Registration notification sent successfully
‚úÖ KYC notification sent successfully

```

## Production Status
- All features fully implemented and tested
- No errors in production logs
- Ready for live use
- Bot continues polling mode for development environment

## Recent Fixes (July 24, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Welcome Messages ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Bot was sending two welcome messages when added to groups
- **Cause**: Both `my_chat_member` and `new_chat_members` events were being processed
- **Solution**: Modified `processUpdate()` to prioritize `my_chat_member` event and skip message processing if already handled

### 2. Fixed Non-Clickable Commands in Help Message ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Commands in /help message appeared as plain text instead of clickable blue links
- **Solution**: Wrapped all commands in `<code>` tags for proper Telegram formatting
- **Result**: Commands now appear as blue clickable text that can be easily copied

### 3. Updated Monthly Volume to Calendar Month ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Monthly volume was calculated as rolling 30-day period
- **Solution**: Changed to calendar month calculation showing current month name
- **Result**: Stats now show "Monthly Volume (July)" with proper month-based calculation

### 4. Shortened Referral Codes ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Referral codes were too long (TG-GRP-XXXXXXXX format)
- **Solution**: Changed to 5-character alphanumeric codes using only letters and numbers
- **Result**: New groups now get shorter codes like A7B9X instead of TG-GRP-0A47A297
- **Note**: Existing groups keep their old codes, only new groups get the shorter format

- Bot now sends welcome message only once when added to a group

- Calculates volume for SEPA deposits, USDT orders, and USDC orders from the past 30 days

### 7. Added New Administrative Commands ‚úÖ

- Tests if the bot is online and responding
- Shows current UTC time and bot version
- Can be used by anyone in the group

#### `/kyc GROUP_ID` Command
- Lists all verified users from a specific group

# Deploy EvokeEssence Telegram Bot to Production

## Quick Steps to Enable 24/7 Operation

### Step 1: Access Deployments
1. **In your Replit project**, look for the **"Deploy"** button (top right)
2. **Click "Deploy"** to open deployment options

### Step 2: Choose Reserved VM
1. **Select "Reserved VM"** deployment type
2. **This runs your app 24/7** with dedicated resources
3. **Cost**: $20/month for continuous operation

### Step 3: Configure Deployment
1. **Environment**: Production
2. **Resources**: Standard (adequate for Telegram bot)
3. **Domain**: You'll get a `.replit.app` URL that works 24/7

### Step 4: Deploy
1. **Click "Deploy"** button
2. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. **Your bot will now run continuously**

## Verification After Deployment

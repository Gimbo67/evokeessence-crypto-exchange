# 🚀 Final 24/7 Deployment Guide - Complete Solution

## The Reality: Polling vs Webhook for 24/7 Operation

You're correct - **polling cannot work without Replit running** because:
- Polling requires an active server process
- When Replit closes, the server stops
- No server = no polling = bot offline

**For true 24/7 operation, you MUST use webhooks with a deployed server.**

## 🎯 Complete 24/7 Solution

### Step 1: Proper Production Deployment
Your current issue is that the webhook is set but not reaching your server. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Deploy to actual production** (not development mode)
2. **Ensure domain points to deployed server**
3. **Webhook will automatically work**

### Step 2: Verify Domain Configuration
Check that `evo-exchange.com` actually points to your deployed server:

```bash
# Test if your domain reaches the right server
curl -I https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram

# Should return 200 OK from YOUR server, not a generic response
```

### Step 3: Environment-Based Webhook Setup
I'll modify the bot to automatically detect true production and set webhooks correctly.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

The bot needs to:
1. **Detect real production environment** (not just Replit development)
2. **Set webhook only when truly deployed**
3. **Use webhook for 24/7 operation**

## 🚨 Current Problem Analysis

Your infrastructure shows:
- Webhook URL set: `https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram` ✅
- Cloudflare bypass active ✅
- But server running in development mode ❌
- Domain not routing to active server ❌

## 🎯 Immediate Solution

I'll create a deployment-aware system that:
1. **Works in development** with polling
2. **Automatically switches to webhook** when properly deployed
3. **Ensures 24/7 operation** without manual intervention

The key is making sure your domain actually points to your deployed server, not just having the webhook set.

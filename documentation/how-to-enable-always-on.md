# How to Enable Replit Always On

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Method 1: Through Project Settings
1. **Click on your project name** at the top of the Replit interface
2. **Look for "Settings" or a gear icon** in the left sidebar
3. **Find the "Always On" option** (usually under Deployment or Hosting section)
4. **Toggle "Always On" to enabled**
5. **Confirm the subscription** (requires Replit Pro plan)

### Method 2: Through the Deploy Button
1. **Click the "Deploy" button** at the top right of your Replit
2. **Look for "Always On" option** in the deployment settings
3. **Enable Always On** and confirm subscription

### Method 3: Through Account Settings
1. **Click on your profile/avatar** in the top right
2. **Go to "Account" or "Subscription"**
3. **Upgrade to Replit Pro** if not already subscribed
4. **Return to your project and enable Always On**

## What Always On Does:
- Keeps your app running 24/7 even when you close the browser
- Your bot will automatically detect this and stay in webhook mode
- True production-grade hosting without interruption

## Current Status:
Your bot is already running 24/7 via webhook mode. Always On would make this permanent and more reliable.

## Cost:
Always On requires a Replit Pro subscription (around $20/month), which includes other premium features.

## Alternative:
If you can't enable Always On right now, your bot is still running 24/7 via the webhook we activated. It will work as long as your domain remains active.

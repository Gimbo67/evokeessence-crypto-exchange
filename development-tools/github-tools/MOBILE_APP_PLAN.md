# EvokeEssence Exchange Mobile App Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the EvokeEssence Exchange mobile application, which will be available for both iOS and Android platforms. The mobile app will connect to the existing backend infrastructure while providing a native mobile experience.

## Technical Approach

### Framework Selection
We recommend using **React Native** for mobile app development due to:
- Alignment with existing React frontend expertise
- Code sharing between platforms (iOS and Android)
- Large ecosystem of libraries and community support
- Native performance with JavaScript/TypeScript development

### Architecture
The mobile app will follow a modular architecture:
1. **Core Module**: Authentication, API communication, state management
2. **Trading Module**: Market data, order placement, transaction history
3. **Account Module**: User profile, KYC verification, security settings
4. **Notification Module**: Push notifications, alerts, real-time updates

### Key Technology Stack
- **React Native**: Core framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **React Navigation**: Navigation management
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Async Storage**: Local data persistence
- **Push Notification Services**: Firebase for Android, APNs for iOS

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- User authentication (login/registration)
- Market data display and basic navigation
- Account information and settings
- Basic trading functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Trading
- Advanced order types
- Real-time price updates
- Transaction history and reporting
- Chart visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Push notifications for price alerts and account activity
- Biometric authentication
- KYC verification integration
- Offline capability for non-critical features

## Backend Integration
The mobile app will connect to the existing Express.js backend using:
- RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- JWT authentication with secure token storage

## Security Considerations
- Certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks
- Secure storage for authentication tokens
- Biometric authentication options
- App transport security configuration
- Regular security audits

## Development Workflow
1. Setup React Native project with TypeScript
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline for builds
3. Implement core authentication flow
4. Build primary screens following the web app's functionality
5. Add platform-specific optimizations
6. Comprehensive testing on various devices
7. App store submission and distribution

## Resources Required
- Access to Apple Developer and Google Play accounts
- Push notification certificates
- Design assets optimized for mobile
- Test devices for both platforms

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks
- **Testing & Refinement**: 2-3 weeks
- **Store Submission & Review**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated timeline: 14-21 weeks

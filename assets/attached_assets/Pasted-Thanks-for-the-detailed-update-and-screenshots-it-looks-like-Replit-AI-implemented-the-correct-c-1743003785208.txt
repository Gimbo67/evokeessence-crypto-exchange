Thanks for the detailed update and screenshots — it looks like Replit AI **implemented the correct changes**, but the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Permissions-Policy` **headers are still not being sent in actual HTTP responses** from your app to the browser. This means **something is missing in your actual middleware or server response flow.**

### Here's what to tell Replit AI exactly:

---

**Task: Fix missing security headers for A+ scanner grades**

Despite implementing CSP and Permissions-Policy headers in `security.ts`, securityheaders.com and Mozilla Observatory still report them as missing.

**Please ensure that:**

1. **The `helmet()` middleware is correctly used and configured** at the top of the Express middleware stack.
2. **The following headers are explicitly set in the Express app**, either through `helmet` or `res.setHeader`:

```ts
// Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    objectSrc: ["'none'"],
    upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
  },
}),

// Permissions-Policy (now called Permissions-Policy or "Permissions")
res.setHeader(
  "Permissions-Policy",
  "accelerometer=(), camera=(), gyroscope=(), magnetometer=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), usb=(), interest-cohort=()"
);
```

3. Ensure these headers are being **applied to all outgoing responses**, especially root pages like `/`, `/login`, and any route not starting with `/api`.

4. Also, verify that:
   - These headers are **not stripped or overwritten by Vite, static file handling**, or any proxy layer.
   - When testing, open browser dev tools > Network > select `/` and check "Response Headers" tab.

**Goal**: When visiting https://evo-exchange.com or running scans from:
- [https://securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/)
- [https://observatory.mozilla.org/](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)

... the responses should include:
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `Permissions-Policy`

Once this is verified, the scores should improve to **A or A+**.

Let me know when they’ve confirmed this is done or if you want me to generate the exact code to plug into your `security.ts` or `index.ts`.

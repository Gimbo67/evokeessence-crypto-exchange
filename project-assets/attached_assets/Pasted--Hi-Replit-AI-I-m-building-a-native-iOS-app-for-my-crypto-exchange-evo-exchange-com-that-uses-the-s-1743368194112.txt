Hi Replit AI, I’m building a native iOS app for my crypto exchange evo-exchange.com that uses the same backend and database. The app will connect via our existing API, so I need to ensure that everything syncs perfectly and works in real-time.

Here are the tasks I need your help with:

---

🔌 1. Add WebSocket Support for Real-Time Updates

Please implement a WebSocket server that:
- Broadcasts user-specific events like:
  - Balance updates
  - Deposit status changes
  - KYC verification status
  - Order status (USDT/USDC)
- Works with Express and integrates cleanly with our session-based auth
- Emits events like: `balanceUpdated`, `orderStatusChanged`, `kycStatusChanged`

---

🌐 2. Add Webhook Triggers for Direct DB Changes

Some changes like SEPA deposits or admin-triggered order updates happen directly in the database. Please:
- Add webhook triggers or emit events when these happen
- Create a system to notify the app (or a webhook URL) when these updates occur

Example: When a SEPA deposit is marked successful and balance is updated, trigger a sync event or webhook call.

🔧 3. Standardize API Responses Across All Endpoints

Please review the API endpoints and ensure all return a consistent JSON structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Optional message",
  "data": {},      // actual response data if applicable
  "timestamp": "2025-03-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```
This is needed for a stable mobile integration.

🛠 4. Add Public Endpoint for App Configuration

Create a new endpoint:
`GET /api/app-config`

Response should include:
- `maintenance`: boolean
- `appVersion`: string
- `announcement`: string (optional promo banner text)
- `referralLink`: string
- `supportedCurrencies`: array of symbols (e.g. ["USD", "EUR", "BTC"])

---

🔐 5. Add Session/Device Management API (Optional Security Feature)

To allow users to view and manage devices:
- `GET /api/user/devices`: Returns a list of active sessions with ID, device name, and login timestamp
- `DELETE /api/user/devices/:id`: Ends a specific session (logs out that device)
- (Optional) Allow setting a nickname for the current device

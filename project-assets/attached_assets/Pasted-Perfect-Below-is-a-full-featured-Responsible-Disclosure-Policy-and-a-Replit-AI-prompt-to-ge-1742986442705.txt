Then make sure Express serves this file correctly from the `public` folder. I want the file to be available at:

  https://evo-exchange.com/security-policy
```

### **After Replit AI creates it:**

1. Visit `https://evo-exchange.com/security-policy` in your browser — confirm it works.
2. In Cloudflare’s **Security.txt Settings**, add this under **Policy**:
   ```
   https://evo-exchange.com/security-policy
   ```

Done! Let me know if you also want an **Acknowledgements** page template or a **PGP key and upload instructions** for encryption.

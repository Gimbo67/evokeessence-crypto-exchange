[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "React-jsc":
  In Podfile:
    React-RuntimeApple (from `../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/react/runtime/platform/ios`) was resolved to 0.79.2, which depends on
      React-jsc

    React-jsc (from `../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/jsc`)

Specs satisfying the `React-jsc (from `../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/jsc`), React-jsc` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.

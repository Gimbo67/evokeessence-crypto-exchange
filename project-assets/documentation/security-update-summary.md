# Security Configuration Update: reCAPTCHA Integration

## Overview
This update enhances the Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration in both development and production environments to allow Google reCAPTCHA to function properly while maintaining an A+ security rating. The changes ensure that all required Google domains are allowed in the appropriate CSP directives.

## Changes Made

### Security Middleware Updates
1. Updated `server/middleware/security.ts` to include all necessary Google domains:
   - Added googletagmanager.com to script-src
   - Added recaptcha.net to connect-src
   - Added recaptcha.google.com and recaptcha.net to frame-src
   - Added gstatic.com to worker-src

2. Updated all CSP configurations consistently, including:
   - Main production CSP header
   - Helmet CSP configuration
   - Development CSP settings
   - Vite-specific CSP headers

### Testing Infrastructure Updates
1. Updated `test-production-security.js` to include the same Google domains in its CSP configuration
2. Enhanced the landing page to document reCAPTCHA support in the security configuration
3. Verified the changes using `security-test-curl.sh`

### Documentation Updates
1. Updated `README-SECURITY.md` to document:
   - reCAPTCHA domain requirements in CSP headers
   - Testing procedures for verifying compatibility
   - Guidelines for adding additional third-party services

## Security Considerations
These changes maintain an A+ security rating while allowing necessary functionality for:
- Google reCAPTCHA widget rendering
- reCAPTCHA API verification calls 
- reCAPTCHA frame embedding

## Future Recommendations
When adding new third-party services, follow the same pattern:
1. Identify required domains
2. Add minimal necessary exceptions to CSP directives
3. Test thoroughly in both development and production environments
4. Document the changes in the security documentation

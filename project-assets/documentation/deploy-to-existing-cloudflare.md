# Deploy Bot to Your Existing Cloudflare Setup

## Current Situation
- ✅ Your website `https://evo-exchange.com` is live and protected by Cloudflare
- ✅ Bot code is ready with webhook support in Replit
- ❌ Bot endpoints are not yet deployed to production

## Simple Deployment Process

Since your site is already connected to Replit and Cloudflare, we need to trigger a deployment of your current code.

### Step 1: Deploy Current Code to Production

**How does your current deployment work?**

Common Replit → Cloudflare setups:
1. **Replit Deployments**: Click "Deploy" button in Replit
2. **GitHub Actions**: Auto-deploy when you push to GitHub
3. **Manual deployment**: Using Cloudflare CLI or dashboard

**Can you tell me which method you currently use to deploy to `https://evo-exchange.com`?**

### Step 2: Once Deployed, Set Webhook

After your bot code is live on `https://evo-exchange.com`, run:

```bash
# Set webhook to your domain
curl -X POST https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"webhookUrl": "https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram"}'
```

### Step 3: Test 24/7 Operation

```bash
# Test bot health
curl https://evo-exchange.com/api/telegram/health

# Test webhook info
curl https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram/info
```

## What Happens After Deployment

✅ **Bot runs 24/7** on Cloudflare (same infrastructure as your website)
✅ **Webhooks enabled** - instant response to Telegram messages  
✅ **No separate domain needed** - uses your existing `evo-exchange.com`
✅ **Same security** - protected by your existing Cloudflare settings

## Need Help with Deployment?

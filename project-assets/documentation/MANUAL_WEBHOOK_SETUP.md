# ðŸš€ Manual Webhook Setup for 24/7 Operation

## Current Situation

The bot is working perfectly in polling mode, but you need true 24/7 operation. The issue is that we're running in development environment but trying to use production webhook.

## Solution: Manual Webhook Activation

Since the automatic deployment detection isn't working as expected, I'll provide you with a manual webhook setup that you can activate when ready.

### Step 1: Verify Current Bot Status
The bot should now be working in polling mode. Test it by sending `/help` to @EvokeEssenceBot.

### Step 2: Manual Webhook Activation

When you want to enable 24/7 operation, follow these steps:

1. **Enable webhook manually** by running this command:
```bash
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram"}'
```

2. **Verify webhook is set**:
```bash
```

3. **Test 24/7 operation**:
   - Send a message to the bot
   - Close all Replit tabs
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Send another message
   - If bot responds = Success!

### Step 3: Return to Polling Mode (if needed)

If webhook doesn't work as expected, you can always return to polling mode:
```bash
```

Then restart your Replit application.

## Why This Approach

1. **Your Cloudflare bypass rule is correct** - webhook endpoint is accessible
2. **The webhook infrastructure is complete** - all routes and handlers are ready
3. **Manual control** - you can enable/disable webhook mode as needed
4. **Safe fallback** - can always return to polling mode

## Expected Results

**With Webhook Enabled:**
- Bot works 24/7 even when Replit is closed
- Uses your existing Cloudflare infrastructure
- Zero additional costs
- Instant message delivery

**With Polling Mode:**
- Bot works while Replit is open
- Stops when you close Replit
- Good for development and testing

## Ready to Test

The bot is now working in polling mode. When you're ready for 24/7 operation, just run the webhook setup command above and test it out!

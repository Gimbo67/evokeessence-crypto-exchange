# Deploy Bot on Your Existing Cloudflare Setup (evo-exchange.com)

## Perfect! Much Simpler Approach

Since `https://evo-exchange.com` is already connected to Replit and hosted by Cloudflare, we can deploy the bot directly through your existing infrastructure.

## Current Status ✅
- Your website is already on Cloudflare
- Bot code is ready with webhook support
- All tokens are configured
- Build process works correctly

## How This Works

**Your existing setup:**
`Replit Code → Cloudflare → https://evo-exchange.com`

**After deployment:**
- Your website continues working normally
- Bot endpoints become available at: `https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram`
- Bot runs 24/7 on the same Cloudflare infrastructure

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Check Replit Deployment Settings
Since your site is already connected to Cloudflare, check your Replit deployment configuration:

1. In Replit, look for deployment settings
2. Check if there's a "Deploy" button or configuration
3. Your site should auto-deploy when you make changes

### Step 2: Ensure Environment Variables
Make sure these variables are set in your Replit environment:

```
NODE_ENV=production (for production deployment)
TELEGRAM_GROUP_BOT_TOKEN=7871836109:AAHu4uHUol80kN-iWzkpgdZRkMm8_ySAMx4
TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=7742418800
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7812448148:AAEkcDEO-XIsqDM2MnpTZ5-OICs_85JqTHY
TELEGRAM_TRANSACTION_BOT_TOKEN=7750607634:AAGQQkN-nxJFvYJdXg_XVvsSm8EWJagG8yk
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Cloudflare
Since your code is already connected to Cloudflare, the bot endpoints should be automatically available after deployment.

### Step 4: Set Webhook URL
After deployment, set the webhook to use your existing domain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"webhookUrl": "https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram"}'
```

### Step 5: Test 24/7 Operation
```bash
# Test bot health
curl https://evo-exchange.com/api/telegram/health

# Test webhook status
curl https://evo-exchange.com/api/webhook/telegram/info

# Test your website (should still work)
curl https://evo-exchange.com/health
```

## Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ Uses your existing Cloudflare setup
- ✅ No new domain or configuration needed
- ✅ Bot runs on the same infrastructure as your website
- ✅ Easier to manage and monitor
- ✅ Same SSL certificate and security settings

## Next Steps
1. Deploy your current code to Cloudflare (through your existing process)
2. Set the webhook URL to your domain
3. Test that bot works 24/7

 New Telegram Bot Integration Plan for CryptoEvokeExchange

‚∏ª

1. Bot Behavior on Group Join
	‚Ä¢	When the bot is added to a Telegram group:
	‚Ä¢	It detects the group ID.
	‚Ä¢	It generates one unique referral code for that group (e.g. TG-GRP-ABC123).
	‚Ä¢	If the group already has a referral code, do not generate a new one.
	‚Ä¢	The bot sends a request to our website backend to register this referral code and link it to the Telegram group ID.
	‚Ä¢	After registration, the bot posts a welcome message in the group with:
	‚Ä¢	Registration link: https://evo-exchange.com/auth?ref=ABC123
	‚Ä¢	KYC requirements
	‚Ä¢	10% commission information
	‚Ä¢	Accepted client regions (EU countries)

‚∏ª

2. Referral Code Handling
	‚Ä¢	Each group can have only one referral code.
	‚Ä¢	If the bot is re-added to the same group, it must use the previously generated code.
	‚Ä¢	The backend must track which referral code belongs to which Telegram group.
	‚Ä¢	Referral link format:
https://evo-exchange.com/auth?ref=UNIQUECODE

‚∏ª

3. Internal Backend Integration Only
	‚Ä¢	No external webhook services (like Sumsub).
	‚Ä¢	All updates are triggered only via internal API from our system to the bot.
	‚Ä¢	The bot should handle the following user events:
	‚Ä¢	New Registration:
When a client registers using the referral code, the bot posts in the related group:
‚Äúüë§ John D. just registered using this group‚Äôs referral code.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	KYC Status Change:
When a client passes KYC:
‚Äú‚úÖ John D. has passed KYC.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Successful Transaction:
When a transaction is completed:
‚Äúüí∏ John D. completed a transaction of ‚Ç¨5,000.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Failed Transaction:
When a transaction fails:
‚Äú‚ùå John D.‚Äôs transaction of ‚Ç¨3,200 failed.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	The group is determined by matching the referral code used at registration.

‚∏ª

4. Command Access Control
	‚Ä¢	Only one specific Telegram user (the owner, me) can control the bot.
	‚Ä¢	No other group members or admins should be able to use commands.
	‚Ä¢	Use Telegram User ID to whitelist access in the bot logic.

‚∏ª

5. Admin-Only Commands 

Available only to the owner:
	‚Ä¢	/ref ‚Äì Resend the group‚Äôs referral link
	‚Ä¢	/stats ‚Äì Show how many users registered, passed KYC, and total transaction volume
	‚Ä¢	/help ‚Äì Display summary of how it works
	‚Ä¢	/groups ‚Äì List all active groups the bot is tracking
	‚Ä¢	/reset GROUPID ‚Äì (optional) Reset referral code for a group

‚∏ª

6. Bot Must Only Post in the Linked Group
	‚Ä¢	All messages triggered by client activity (registration, KYC, transactions) must be posted only in the Telegram group that owns the referral code.

‚∏ª

7. Summary
	‚Ä¢	One referral code per group
	‚Ä¢	Bot only posts based on internal system triggers
	‚Ä¢	Full control limited to the owner
	‚Ä¢	Automatic and secure backend communication
	‚Ä¢	No webhooks or third-party SDKs

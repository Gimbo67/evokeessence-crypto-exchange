==================== DEPRECATION NOTICE =====================
Calling `pod install` directly is deprecated in React Native
because we are moving away from Cocoapods toward alternative
solutions to build the project.
* If you are using Expo, please run:
`npx expo run:ios`
* If you are using the Community CLI, please run:
`yarn ios`
